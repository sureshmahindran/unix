PUPPET SETUP
============

=> Client/Server communication is via https (port 8140)

HOSTS Involved:
----------------------------------
Master: 
IP ADDR : 192.168.122.20
Hostname: masterxl6.example.com

Client Server:
IP ADDR : 192.168.122.21
Hostname: node1xl6.example.com
----------------------------------

=>Add host entries on both client and master's /etc/hosts file when dns is not configured. Example:-

#cat /etc/hosts
192.168.122.20		masterxl6.example.com
192.168.122.21		node1xl6.example.com



=> Download and install puppetlabs package repositry

# rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-5.noarch.rpm	  =>   For RHEL/CentOS 5

# rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-6.noarch.rpm          =>   For RHEL/CentOS 6

# rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-7.noarch.rpm	  =>  For RHEL/CentOS 7


PUPPET MASTER:
=============
=> Install puppet-Server package
#yum install puppet-server

=>Next, run the following command to upgrade Puppet to most newest version
#puppet resource package puppet ensure=latest

=> Once upgrade process completes, you will need to restart the puppet master server to reflect new changes.
#/etc/init.d/puppetmaster start

#puppet --version

#chkconfig puppetmaster on


CLIENT:
======

=>Install puppet agent package
#yum install puppet

#/etc/init.d/puppet start

#chkconfig puppet on

=> On agent configure:

[root@node1 tmp]# cat /etc/sysconfig/puppet
PUPPET_SERVER=puppetmaster.example.com

[root@node1 tmp]# cat /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
[agent]
    server=puppetmaster.example.com

=>Now you can start your Puppet client:
# service puppet start

=========================================================================

To Register puppet agent to puppet Server :
------------------------------------------

1. CLIENT:

=> We need to force our client to check in with the Puppet master by using:
# puppet agent --test

=>You should see something like the following output. Don't panic, this is desired as the server is still not verified on the Puppet master server.

Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled


2. MASTER:

=> Go back to your puppet master server and check certificate verification requests:

[root@masterxl6 ~]# puppet cert list
  "node1xl6.example.com" (SHA256) E4:5D:9C:5E:3D:3E:9C:F9:98:17:C8:86:55:A0:B8:1A:25:F1:0B:64:FC:31:5B:FE:7A:30:31:B2:1D:8D:C1:0D

=> Sign the Certificate with below command .

[root@masterxl6 ~]# puppet cert sign node1xl6.example.com
Notice: Signed certificate request for node1xl6.example.com
Notice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest node1xl6.example.com at '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/node1xl6.example.com.pem'

3. CLIENT:

=> Run below command on agent to verify
#puppet agent -t


More Commands:
=============

=>find out where the master manifest file is located:

[root@puppetmaster manifests]# puppet master --configprint manifest

/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp


=>To get an overview of all available settings and their values, use the following command:

root@puppetmaster# puppet master --configprint all | less
